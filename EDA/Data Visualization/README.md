Data Visualization Project – Internship Task3

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Description:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: student_performance.csv.
This project uses student performance data to create simple and clear visualizations.
It shows how total scores are distributed, compares performance across grades, and identifies 
factors influencing academic results using Python libraries.

Key Questions:
1. How are student's total scores distributed?
2. Does student performance vary across grades?
3. Which factors influence the total score?

Insights:
1. Most students score in the higher range, showing strong overall academic performance.
2. Grade A students achieve the highest average total scores, followed by B and C, indicating performance varies clearly by grade.
3. Weekly self-study hours strongly affect total scores, while attendance has minimal impact. 
   Class participation may contribute slightly but is less significant.

Output:
Histogram showing distribution of total scores.
Bar chart comparing grades and average total scores.
Heatmap displaying correlation among numerical features.

Conclusion:
Visualizations reveal patterns in student performance and highlight key factors affecting results, demonstrating how data visualization turns raw data into actionable insights.
