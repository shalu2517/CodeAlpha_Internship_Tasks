Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Internship Task2

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Description:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: student_performance.csv.
This project performs exploratory data analysis on a student performance dataset. 
It includes data structure exploration, missing value detection, statistical analysis, 
visualizations, and insights on factors affecting student performance.

Insights:
1. The dataset is clean with no missing values.
2. Most students perform very well, scoring in the higher range.
3. More self-study hours clearly lead to higher total scores.
4. Attendance alone does not strongly affect performance.
5. Students with higher grades consistently achieve better scores.
